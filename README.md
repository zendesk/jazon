# Jazon
A library for test assertions on JSON payloads. 

Supports Spock and JUnit. Easy to extend for other test frameworks and languages.

## About

Jazon was created to make writing tests on JSON APIs easy. It offers:
* Simple exact-match assertions on JSON
* Matching unordered JSON arrays (ability to ignore the items order)
* User-defined wildcard assertions, e.g.
    * Match string to a regex
    * Match number to a range
    * Match datetime to some specific format
    * Verify that float has only 2 decimal points
    * Verify that list has only 25 items
    * ... anything you need
* Human-readable error messages for fast mismatch tracing
* Optimised to minimise code duplication 

## Using Jazon in your project

Jazon is provided as separate libraries (so called adapters) for each supported testing framework.
Depending on the framework you use, pick the adapter library that is applicable for you.
