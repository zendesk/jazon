# Jazon
A library for test assertions on JSON outputs. 

Supports Spock and JUnit. Easy to extend for other test frameworks and languages.

## About

Jazon was created to make writing tests on JSON APIs easy. It offers:
* Simple Exact-match assertions on JSON
* Matching unordered JSON arrays (ability to ignore the items order)
* User-defined wildcard assertions, e.g.
    * Match string to a regex
    * Match number to a range
    * Match datetime to some specific format
    * Verify that float has only 2 decimal points
    * Verify that list has only 25 items
    * ... anything you need
* Human-readable error messages for fast mismatch tracing
* Optimised to minimise code duplication
